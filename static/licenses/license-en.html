and Waiver of Class Action.  </B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">If
you are a resident of the United States, this Section 14 applies to
you. Arbitration is a form of private dispute resolution in which
persons with a dispute waive their rights to file a lawsuit, to
proceed in court and to a jury trial, and instead submit their
disputes to a neutral third person (or arbitrator) for a binding
decision.  You have the right to opt-out of this Section (as
explained below), which means you would retain your right to litigate
your disputes in a court, either before a judge or jury.</FONT></P>

read this Section carefully. It provides that all Disputes between
you and Leap Motion, Inc. (as defined below, for this Section) shall
be resolved by binding arbitration.  Arbitration replaces the right
to go to court.  In the absence of this arbitration agreement, you
may otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims in court,
before a judge or jury, and/or participate in or be represented in a
case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class
actions). Except as otherwise provided, entering into this agreement
constitutes a waiver of your right to litigate claims and all
opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury.  There is no judge or
jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is
limited. The arbitrator must follow this Agreement and can award the
same damages and relief as a court (including attorneys’ fees).</FONT></P>

Award.</U></FONT><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">  The
arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be
available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to
award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not
a party to the proceeding.  The arbitrator will make any award in
writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested
by a party.  Such award will be final and binding on the parties,
except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be
entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for

Except as otherwise provided in this Section, the arbitrator may not

preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or
claims (such as a class action, consolidated action or private
attorney general action) unless both you and Leap Motion specifically
agree to do so following initiation of the arbitration.  If you
choose to pursue your Dispute in court by opting out of this Section,
as specified above, this Class Action Waiver will not apply to you. 
Neither you, nor any other user of the Site can be a class
representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class,
consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied
